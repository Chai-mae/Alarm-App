 In our final project we have chosen to work on an Alarm application. In fact this application has been a good opportunity for us to practice the skills we have learned in writing multi-platform GUI applications using the Qt library Course. 
 
**<h2>Application description</h2>**

 
Our application is implemented using the MVC model :

* QStandardItemModel as a model :QStandardItemModel can be used as a repository for standard Qt data types. It is one of the Model/View Classes and is part of Qt's model/view framework. QStandardItemModel provides a classic item-based approach to working with the model. The items in a QStandardItemModel are provided by QStandardItem.
* QListView as a view : The QListView class implements a list/tree view. It can display and control a hierarchy of multi-column items, and provides the ability to add new items at any time. Among others the user may select one or many items and sort the list in increasing or decreasing order by any column.
* 
Our application has the following features :

* Alarm
* Chronometer
* Timer
* Analog Clock
